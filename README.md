### Why Binance Smart Chain \(BSC\)?

In very simple terms, why would we want to drive a slower car that costs more to run? We're all about gamification, so we want to maximize the feedback loop of earning, staking, and earning again: BSC's superior speed and much \(much much\) lower transaction fees let us do this.

While BSC might not have the level of adoption Ethereum does at current, we believe in Binance’s ability and drive to get it mighty close in the foreseeable future.

Faster. Cheaper. Sold.

Now get flipping! 🍕 🍕
